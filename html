        <h3>Mac Miller was an American rapper, songwriter, singer, producer and instrumentalist. 
This page will introduce him through two timelines. One on his life journey and the other one on his musical journey. Let's begin with the first one:</h3>
        <section name="timeline">
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">1992</span> - Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1998</span> - Learned guitar, piano, drums and bass self-taught by the age of 6.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">2006</span> - Fell in love with hip-hop and weed. Started posting videos of him rapping.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">2007</span> - <span class="quote">But My Macking' Ain't Easy</span>, first released music project. Age: 15.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">2011</span> - <span class="quote">Blue Slide Park</span>, after a few successful mixtapes radiating frat rap and cool kid energy, he released his first album with a more personal and serious theme. People didn't like it and began shaming him for it and many other things. Big lose of confidence. As of this moment, he began getting deeper and deeper into drugs...</li>
            <li><span class="bold">2011</span> - The <span class="quote">Macadelic</span> mixtape really showed us a darker version of him. Transformed by the other side of the coin of success and now completely into lean (a really strong drug).</li>
            <li><span class="bold">2012-2013</span> - produced two instrumental projects: <span class="quote">Run-On Sentences: Vol. 1 | Stolen Youth</span>, as "Larry Fisherman" and one jazz project: <span class="quote">You</span> as "Larry Lovestein".</li>
            <li><span class="bold">2013-2015</span> - <span class="quote">Watching Movies with the Sound Off | GO:OD AM</span>, two albums released after his first struggles. The fans are less gossipy.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">2016</span> - <span class="quote">The Divine Feminine</span>, album released after alternating moments of heavy drug dependence and great success in the music industry. This time it began to look brighter for him as he almost completely stopped doing drugs, as incredible as it sounds. The album has a more positive vibe to it, getting inspirations from love.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">2018</span> - <span class="quote">Swimming</span>. Two years later, Mac's demons resurface and he struggles fighting them but still manages to deliver a message of hope thought his album despite the situation he is in.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">2018</span> - One month after releasing his last album, Mac Miller is found dead at home, at age 26. Autopsy revealed he died in an overdose of multiple drugs including fentanyl. The problem is, Mac never took fentanyl before in his life. An investigation begins...</li>
            <li><span class="bold">2022</span> - The investigation finds out Mac's dealer and other guys replaced the initial drug Mac was initially supposed to get with fentanyl, being 50x more powerful than the other one, causing him to overdose and die. These people involved in his death are sentenced to prison.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Until today</span> - People have continued to perpetuate his memory. Through music with his post-mortem album <span class="quote">Circles</span>, but also through speeches and many other types of tributes. This one included. </li>
      </section>

        <div class="commentary">That was Mac Miller, he was self-made, he suffered from success which ultimately was fatal to him. The thing with him, is that he is genuinely honest. He never hid nor value his addiction problems, in fact, he always fought them. He always purely told us how he felt through his music and that's what makes his story precious in my opinion. </div>
        <h3>If you're interested in listening to his music, I think you could enjoy <a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrR_gm6RqCo">this video</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88KAks_f5eU">that video</a> as much as I did.</h3>
